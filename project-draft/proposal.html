        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        Our group is interested in solving problems that are related to climate change. There are many subtopics that are included but not limited to the cause of the extreme weather such as burning coal, oil, and gas that produces greenhouse gases, increasing livestock farming, and growing food and water waste etc. We would like to collect usersâ€™ data of their life style in order to provide them knowledge about how their actions can impact the environment. Currently, there are some applications of information technology that helps address the problem like the invention of electric cars. However, not everyone can afford them. Additionally, we believe that everyone can participate in the action of being more environmental friendly just by noticing and changing a bit of their lifestyles.

        <a href="https://everydropnola.com/#you">Every Drop</a> is a website that serves as a forum for shared ideas, tools, and resources to help water conservation. They provide tips on how people can do to save water in their daily lives. Nevertheless, because it mainly provides location-based information, it can limit their target audience. In addition, the website only focuses on water conservation, but we want to expand the dimensions of climate change to more people.

        <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        Our target audience for our application is individuals who are concerned about their daily and cumulative environmental impacts. Since our app allows the user to input certain actions (such as taking a 15 minute shower or driving a certain car) and view & track their environmental impacts, it makes sense that the users of the application would be interested in learning more about their environmental impacts and likely reducing them based on the feedback from the app.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data sources:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www3.epa.gov/carbon-footprint-calculator/">https://www3.epa.gov/carbon-footprint-calculator/ (Download for data by clicking calculator in excel)</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/owid/co2-data">https://github.com/owid/co2-data</a></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Interactivity</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>We want users to be able to view what effect their actions are having on the environment. We are expecting the interactive part of our website to allow users to input their daily habits. This can be things as mundane as how long they shower or how far they drive to as detailed as how much electricity their household uses. Using this information, the web app will give the user a sustainability score and allow them to view their chosen metric of measurement.</li>
        <li>The second possible interactive feature could be allowing users to see how much CO2 they generate weigh against something (like how many cyber trucks of CO2 did you generate this year?) Users will be able to drag cars or houses on a scale to weigh against their weight of CO2.</li>
        <li>The third interactive element will be a quiz type. Users will be able to gain knowledge about their habits and the environment in general. Quiz questions will aim to enlighten users on how harmful or good their habits are.</li>
        <li>Another interactive element we could feature would be allowing users to create profiles and log in before filling out their activities. This way users would be able to track if their habit changes from a month or year ago had a net positive growth. Additionally it could be cool to let users see each other growth's and profiles.</li>
        <li>Finally we want users to gain coins for their progress for improving their actions or scoring well on the quiz. These coins will allow users to purchase items for their avatar through our in app store. Their avatar's drip will represent their progress for commiting to greener habits.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The biggest way our app will help to solve our problem is through awareness. One of the biggest issues regarding climate change is ignorance. If people can see the quantitative impact of their actions in a metric that speaks to them, they will be swayed to change.
