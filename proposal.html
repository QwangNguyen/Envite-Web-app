      <h2>Problem Description</h2>

      <p>
        Our group is interested in solving problems that are related to climate change. There are many subtopics that are included but not limited to the cause of the extreme weather such as burning coal, oil, and gas that produces greenhouse gases, increasing livestock farming, and growing food and water waste etc. We would like to collect usersâ€™ data of their life style in order to provide them knowledge about how their actions can impact the environment. Currently, there are some applications of information technology that helps address the problem like the invention of electric cars. However, not everyone can afford them. Additionally, we believe that everyone can participate in the action of being more environmental friendly just by noticing and changing a bit of their lifestyles.

        Every Drop <a href="https://everydropnola.com/#you"></a> is a website that serves as a forum for shared ideas, tools, and resources to help water conservation. They provide tips on how people can do to save water in their daily lives. Nevertheless, because it mainly provides location-based information, it can limit their target audience. In addition, the website only focuses on water conservation, but we want to expand the dimensions of climate change to more people.
